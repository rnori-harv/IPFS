# Soham Bose and Rakesh Nori's CS 262 Final Project: Recreating IPFS
Proof of Concept for recreating IPFS. Final Project for CS 262 @ harvard.


## How to Use

The process for starting our version of IPFS locally is very simple.

### Launching server
Go the backend directory and write `python3 launch.py` into your shell to launch the IPFS nodes.

### Launching client
Go the frontend directory and type `flask run` into your shell to launch the client. Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the web client for IPFS. 

### Write-up
